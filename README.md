# hello-world

Hello everyone,

On GitHub I go by tinkerer-tobe. I am hoping to learn coding/programming for robotics and AI. I am completely new so I have a lot to learn. Anyone that would like to take me on as a padewan learner it would be greatly appreciated. Your time for taking a know-nothing to a well versed know-something will not go unrecognized.
